    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I was a Geophysicist who work on subsurface data to understand the Earth's interior. I had discovered
        something very exciting for me while I was learning how to collect and process data to better visualize and 
        interpret the Earth's subsurface. This was the passion to analyse what we observe and to continuously learn 
        from our observations. This passion lead me to study the theory behind the dynamics of the Earth and I decided 
        on doing my master degree in theoretical geophysics. During my educational journay, I had enjoyed programming based 
        on Earth physics, and coding mathematical models to create artifical data that results in subsurface models of Earth. 
        Then, I have realized that there are continuosly recording data available in this modern World from that 
        we can derive valuable information for a specific purpose. Eventually, this awereness motivates me on developing learning algorithms 
        that helps to better analyse available data and make them meaningful and useful for future. 
        I thus joined a bootcamp to evolve my programming skills. 
        Later on, I have started to work as software developer for MS CRM Dynamics in 2021. 
        Now, I have been developing algorithms to support better organizing CRM data in MS Dynamics.
